Installation instructions. In this example we use python3's venv. Feel free to use conda or any other package manager of your choice.

- Create a virtual environment and load it
```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
```
- Install qibo
```bash
pip install qibo
```
- Clone our fork of the CAS repository and install it interactively
```bash
git clone https://github.com/visagim/CAS
cd CAS
pip install -e .
```
- Install jupyter notebook
```bash
pip install notebook
```
The problem that you need to solve and deliver is in the notebook *problem*. In cas you do not know where to begin, you can check the tutorials for the Theory/Software and Hardware that we have prepared for you.
You will find the tutorial for the first part of the challenge in the folder **Tutorials** named as *max-cut-example*.
The tutorial for the Hardware part is in the same folder under the name of *hardware-tutorial*.

Good luck!
